                    <p>BrewForge is for people who enjoy playing tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons and
                        Dragons,
                        Pathfinder, Fantasy Flight Star Wars, and many more. Here you can access and download
                        adventure
                        modules, full campaigns, and an array of quality role-playing content that others have
                        created and
                        shared. Do all of this for free, or, with a $5 monthly subscription, remove ads from your
                        browsing
                        experience, get access to additional content, such as premium adventure modules, and help
                        grow

                        In addition to being able to access and download content, you can share your own
                        role-playing
                        creations, adventures, maps, characters etc. The world will be able to see, use, and
                        endorse your
                        creations. With a Game Master membership of $15 dollars you gain all the benefits of a base
                        BrewForge membership and are able to host all of your content on BrewForge servers. With
                        Game
                        Master privileges you are also eligible to receive donations from users who endorse your
                        content
                        (with a small portion of the donation going to the site for hosting content).
